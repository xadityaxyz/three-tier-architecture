# AWS Three Tier Web Architecture 

## Description: 
This workshop is a hands-on walk through of a three-tier web architecture in AWS. We will be manually creating the necessary network, security, app, and database components and configurations in order to run this architecture in an available and scalable manner.

## Audience:
Although this is an introductory level workshop, it is intended for those who have a technical role. The assumption is that you have at least some foundational aws knowledge around VPC, EC2, RDS, S3, ELB and the AWS Console.  

## Pre-requisites:
1. An AWS account. If you don’t have an AWS account, follow the instructions [here](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and
click on “Create an AWS Account” button in the top right corner to create one.
